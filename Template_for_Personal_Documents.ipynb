Firstly, a successful manager should be honest with employees regarding their performance levels so that they are aware of any improvements or weaknesses in an attempt to continuously improve themselves and others around them (One-Minute Managers). Secondly, it is important for managers to communicate clearly what's expected from staff members. And thirdly, a good manager should be fair when dealing with employees by avoiding favoritism towards anyone or showing bias in any manner. Fourthly, they need to provide feedback on performance and give constructive criticism where necessary while also recognizing the achievements of others (One-Minute Managers). Last but not least is that a good manager must have high ethical standards by demonstrating integrity and respect for their employees as well as themselves; this will in turn lead them to become one minute managers."
